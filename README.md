# Tic Tac Toe

This is a **Java** based multiplayer program that allows the user to play a childhood favorite game of mine called Tic-Tac-Toe.

# How to Play

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

**2.**  You are  **X**, your friend (or the computer in this case) is  **O**. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

**3.**  The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

**4.**  When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
